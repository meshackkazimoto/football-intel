FOOTBALL-INTEL — NEXT BACKEND PHASE: ANALYTICS & INTELLIGENCE DEPTH
=====================================================================

CURRENT PRODUCT STATE
---------------------
The backend has reached high maturity with the following core football
features already implemented:

- Match results
- Fixtures system
- Live match streaming (SSE)
- Player intelligence profiles
- Club intelligence profiles
- Squads & lineups
- Transfers tracking
- Real-time standings computation
- Background workers for recomputation
- Notification system
- Advanced search with filters

At this stage, the platform has strong feature breadth. The next step
is not additional CRUD endpoints, but deeper football intelligence.

=====================================================================
NEXT STEP — ADVANCED MATCH STATISTICS & ANALYTICS
=====================================================================

This phase focuses on intelligence depth rather than new entity creation.
The goal is to transform the platform from a football data system into
a football intelligence system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MATCH STATISTICS ENGINE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Per Match Analytics:
- Possession percentage
- Shots on target
- Shots off target
- Corners
- Fouls
- Yellow cards summary
- Red cards summary
- Saves
- Pass accuracy
- Expected Goals (xG) — optional later

These statistics are derived from match events and computed metrics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. TEAM ANALYTICS ENDPOINTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Endpoint Example:
GET /teams/:id/stats?season=...

Return Metrics:
- Goals scored
- Goals conceded
- Clean sheets
- Average goals per match
- Win/Draw/Loss ratio
- Home vs Away performance
- Form (last 5 matches)

Purpose:
Provides performance insights for clubs and analysts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PLAYER ANALYTICS ENDPOINTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Endpoint Example:
GET /players/:id/stats?season=...

Return Metrics:
- Goals
- Assists
- Minutes played
- Yellow/Red cards
- Shots
- Pass accuracy
- Heatmap data (future enhancement)

Purpose:
Transforms player profiles into analytical performance dashboards.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. FORM & MOMENTUM ENGINE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
For both clubs and players:
- Last 5 matches
- Win/Draw/Loss streaks
- Momentum score
- Performance trends

Purpose:
Improves user perception and engagement by showing recent performance
rather than static totals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. HEAD‑TO‑HEAD (H2H) INTELLIGENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Endpoint Example:
GET /matches/h2h?teamA=...&teamB=...

Return Data:
- Last 10 encounters
- Win ratios
- Goals scored vs conceded
- Historical trends

Purpose:
Highly demanded feature for fans, analysts, and media coverage.

=====================================================================
REMAINING FEATURE PHASES
=====================================================================

PHASE A — ANALYTICS DEPTH (CURRENT TARGET)
- Match statistics
- Team analytics
- Player analytics
- Form engine
- Head‑to‑Head intelligence

PHASE B — PREDICTIVE / AI INTELLIGENCE (FUTURE)
- Match predictions
- Player ratings
- Injury impact analysis
- Probability and outcome models

PHASE C — POLISH & OPTIMIZATION
- Advanced caching
- Pagination tuning
- Data validation rules
- Performance optimization

=====================================================================
SUMMARY
=====================================================================

The backend has achieved feature coverage. The next evolution is
intelligence depth. This phase focuses on analytical insight rather
than additional entities or endpoints.

Completion of Phase A will position the platform as a true
FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM rather than a standard football API.
